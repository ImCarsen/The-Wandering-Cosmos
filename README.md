## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

If you would like to contribute, you may need to run the bot for yourself (which complicates things a little)

Since the bot manage a private subreddit, you will either need to make your own, or do isolated testing.
There are lots of comments, so hopefully that helps!

There are 3 provided .ini files which will need to be configured before you start.
Feel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ImCarsen/The-Wandering-Cosmos/issues) if you want to contribute.<br />
